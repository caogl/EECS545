This is the final project of the course "EECS545: Machine Learning"
===================================================================

--Kernel K-means and Inverse Weighed K-Means method as a robust method for substituting traditional K-Means

--Studied and implemented the Trimmed K-means method under the Lasso and Ridge constraint to deal with irrelevant features and sparse data; used the gradient descent method with a shift in the constraint boundary to get numeric solution

--Applied these robust K-Means algorithm to pattern recognition of handwritten digits





#The Matlab codes for the four method implemented in this project are in the corresponding subfiles

#The project description as well as the final project is in the file "Report.pdf"

#See "poster.pptx" for the poster made for the final presentation
