project summary

                --Kernel K-means and Inverse Weighed K-Means method as a robust method for substituting traditional K-Means

                --Studied and implemented the Trimmed K-means method under the Lasso and Ridge constraint to deal with irrelevant features and sparse data; 
                
                --Used the gradient descent method with a shift in the constraint boundary to get numeric solution

                --Applied these robust K-Means algorithm to pattern recognition of handwritten digits

-------The final project is a team project done by Adam Norton, Yinghe and me. I mainly did two parts, first is the inverse weighted K-Means method, and I also participated in modeling of Trimed K-means, especially I derive the numerical solution under lasso and Ridge constraint. I'm familiar with all parts of the project.
